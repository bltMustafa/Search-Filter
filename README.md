# Search-Filter
Simple search filtering I have done with React 

While creating this simple project, I installed React with Vite. If you don't know how to install Vite, you can click on the  <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/"> "Learn Vite" </a> article to read about it. Afterwards, I generated random data in JSON format from Mockaroo and placed it in a file named 'Data'. Then, I imported and used it in my App.jsx file.
